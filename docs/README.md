# DataIntel

The DataIntel architecture is built on a few core services:

- [Authentication + Authorization](./services/auth)
- [Documents](./services/documents)

## Getting Started

The first place to start is by reading the _Getting Started_ sections for each of the services. These will give you a basic understanding of what each service does independent of all other services.

## Reference

All requests to services and all responses from services MUST have JSON content types.
